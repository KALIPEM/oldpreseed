			      <details>
              <summary>Other Preseed Startups (through TSF)</summary>
              <div class="faq__content"style="color: #000; font-size: 16px;">
        <p><small>On the above section on our homepage we will list only those startups which are built by Nishchal & team out of Nishchal's own itch and fundamental ideas. Preseed has been essentially built as a machine where Nishchal can float such lofty ideas and see them take shape. 
		Basically, startups born in Preseed out of its first purpose of assisting Nishchal's lofty goals, are Preseed homepage worthy startups, directly and by default, for they are what are inseperable from the brand of Preseed. Infact, it is the story of Preseed is that is giving birth to them.</p>

		      <p></i> Furthermore, the relevance of making Preseed home page around only Nishchal's startups ensures - Preseed must and will first only represent that which it was started to do - which is, assisting in the creation of Nishchal's own startup MVPs, above all else. 
			  For, in Nishchal's altruism we trust the most. We trust that he will make for only altrusitic reasons, both startups and money. For him altruism is not a cliche from the world of righteousness. It is a real state of heart of some. The fewest in the world is this breed.</i></p>
  		      
<p>  For all other startups in the world, interested in us - TSF is an independent investment facilitation unit of Preseed that may or may not have the same terms as Preseed. 
	Our financial expert and investment advisor, Kartik, decides those terms based on each independent case at TSF. He will get in touch with you after you apply in TSF.</small></p>

            </details>
	    
	    <p style="color: white; text-align: center;"> Now, since Nishchal has achieved MVP level goals with his own 2 startups, Preseed will aid you too in building your startups the way Preseed aided in co-building Nishchal’s above mentioned two Startups - <b>MIND OVER MATTER</b>. 
	   So, Preseed is being made available through its investment banking team and its <mark>upcoming startup fund, TSF (The Simple Fund)</mark>, for you and your startups, shortly. </p>

                                    journeyed into Preseed to empower those with a will to do
                                    something out of the ordinary - by often encouraging them to drop
                                    out of their
                                    colleges or

                                    ago, I asked myself the question about what is the one thing I must

        All to be woven into one app. That is the product the below mentioned man is building.
        <br><br>
        
        After the product, Nishchal intends to get on the journey to take its impact along with Preseed's to the grass roots of India. He will be among your primeminesterial candidates someday with strength of character and awareness, through the contemporary self, unlike any other Primeminesterial contender of the past. 
       . 

How will we measure that? By actually finding out, the obvious - life of action historically, if need be, from birth; and - how many unprincipled, easily
        swayed, infirm (but, only conviniently firm about dogmas and easily sold to money to comprimise on dogmas, simultaneusly, दोग़ला/double faced), corrupt, lazy, dumb, obstructive, evil, dramatic, passive, aggressive and bitter forces did that person
        righteously piss off to hold his culture's values intact regardless of the costs. <br><br>
		  
		  In case of Nishchal we can safely say, many, and still counting. He bets, the same people who he may have piseed off may still have grand words for him if they speak from their silent core. Why? For, only truth he revered. We are not talking about ordinary kind of pissing of with one's audacity. We
        are
        talking about, pissing off the wrong one pointing the gun on you, kind of pissing off. Why? Because in law of
        the land
        he trusts. 
		  <br><br>
		  So, we will bow down to nothing, no one, except the law of the land. For the culture at Preseed,
        Nishchal will ensure is the culture of truth and fearlessness.  Culture is everything. Our culture is about technological research and development, above all else that you will find here.
        <br><br>
        
        Our app called  <a href="https://chattodo.preseed.in/">Chattodo/कार्यकरता</a> is our next step for you. It is here that that our party members will communicate and collaborate with each other to craft our vision of India. Our party Chatbot will take your onboarding forward.

        <p>We want to give greater freedom to humans in order to make a few among them, a new breed of conscientious humans. We believe that the right time has come to fulfill our goal and this is also the right time for political will to join that same entrepreneurial goal. For, we are first building this app to launch our founder, Nishchal's own political movement. His party may become the first political party in the world to have its 'own' communication app. RSS can continue on whatsapp while Nishchal's party will build its members force on Chattodo.
        <br><br>
	We are ensuring for us, that we have a role to play in the election of the future prime minister of India, by way of the questions we will ask, and the answers we will revceive from what will be know as the Preseed team. May the best human win! Whether from the Preseed team or not, is secondary for us. So, the establishment will always be asked questions and/or shown pathways by way of our prototypes. We invite them to do what we are doing, for the sake of our country, BHARAT, that is India. And, if they do, our goal would be achieved!

If you know our founder, you know what can happen in favour of India if he is successful in building this incubator, Preseed, exactly as envisioned. Although, the truth is, life is a matter of cosmic waves, larager than oceanic waves. So it is what happens when we are busy making other plans. Often the plans we make that work out, are infact the plans that got made out of a non work state of mind. Anyway, if we digress in the direction of the last statement, you will have to know from Nishchal, directly, what is all we humans have the free will for then, if outcomes are already written by 'GOD', <i>which is not even there</i>. WOAH! Not even there. WTF? Anyway, let us get back to work for now. So, he has given Preseed its action, altruism, unwavering will, two portfolio startups, space and culture. 
He is shouldering the responsibility from the front of bringing about the changes in the world reflecting from, the Preseed Home Page Startups, Preseed website words and permanent workation culture at Preseed. Join us on this mission dear lovers, friends and foes. For this is a mission about your own country and your global fellow beings.

So, you may totally skip the above video for now, if you wish.
		On his webpage we are revealing the depths of Nishchal to the best of our abitlity. There you will find content worth 3 great books of our times in the making, made up of blogs and videos instead, that will be known to have gone beyond your definitions of honor-dishonor, black-white, god-nogod. So colorful is his spirit. We have spent 1 full year, 2021-2022, in organising its associated content including its menu bar. May his dreams, rationality and optimism touch each one of you. 
		Btw, this video is being shot on one of the most difficult, and perhaps a historical day from Nishchal's life. We salute Nishchal's effort of the last 14 years 2007-2021, in giving us such rare social media content. 
		His content will be among his shiniest legacies several decades down. Why several decades down? Because, majority, the sheep among you, will take that long to wake up.

              "<b>Through our Medium blog,<a href="https://medium.com/the-preseed">Preseed Essays</a><b> , I want to bring more clarity to the public conversation on
              what’s really happening in the world. Too much of the public discussion is focused either on the wrong issues stemming
              from past (madhya kaal/middle age of India) or is extremely confused to ever get to discuss the future that science
              fiction has always revealed as, coming. People are flooded by enormous amounts of repetitive information of ancient
              past, which they don’t know how to make sense of, so they just do what the herd does, follow each other, blindly, and
              mostly in surrender to only their egos.
                <br><br>
I see my mission as bringing clarity to the public discussion especially in terms of focusing people’s attention on the
most important questions that will confront us in 5 years. Question and not answers, for I don’t have all the answers.
The important thing is, to agree about the questions. For questions will set the tone of our discourse for the sake of a
better future. <br><br>

	We have a lever but not a place to stand yet. Support a company that is working tirelessly to walk the talk by creating actual products that if grown for the next 5 years, i.e. 2029, can solve some very important large problems. 
	Of course, if you will, support us by reading and engaging with our content which is an endeavor to make this world a more truthful place. We will create a place to stand.

There are 10 big challenges to humankind in the 21st century - <br><br>
1. the nuclear war, <br>
2. climate change, <br>
3. technological disruption, <br>
4. pathetic criminal justice system, <br>
5. the selfish capitalism (not, modified capitalism) or mindless consumerism, <br>
6. representative democracy, <br>
7. media accountability, <br>
8. no universal basic income, <br>
9. parenting, <br>
10. Yoga and the education system. <br>
<br>
These should be the first 10 items on the political agenda of every country. 10th point is our first point of focus. We expect to graduate over time to cover them all.
Yoga be considered the most important, for finding tranquility amidst turbulence. In that, Gyan Yog. Nishchal's essays are about thisand more. <br><br>
He will continue to add his videos from<b>our Youtube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOUT-rt9ivFg2C6k81bRyNQ">Preseed Admin</a><b> 
 too, in these essays, at the right places, so as to put his
thoughts spread across years in an all rounded cohesive perspective for even the least intelligent. <br><br>
We request you to read the descriptions on each Youtube video. <br><br>
In totality, Nishchal effort on this essay are made up of about 100000+ words. So, if you go through them you will go through,
say, 20+ Chapters worth of reading to understand, how serious we are about changing the world around you — through the
culmination of it all into codes to make that change as is expressed through this website, merealy a doorway. <br><br>
Don't click on the above links yet, for they are a work in progress, and will remain so for long periods of time. For, Nishchal's goal is to be an entreprenuer of magnitiude, not an author of magnitude. MOreover, we don't have a replacement of him on authorship, not yet. 
		    <b>So, we are looking for one to make a dedicated career out of authorship at Preseed, all the way to drafting Preseed's political manifesto for India, upon which Nishchal expects to see the birth of a new political party in India, from the future. If you are that person, get hold of Nishchal.</b> <br><br>

                        happiness it
                        liberates.
                        Only if your action is an expression of your joy it is worthwhile
                        otherwise it
                        is just
                        an
                        exploitation.</p>
                  
                 <h2 style="color: #000;">     <b>Dharma:</b></h2>
                      <p style="color: #000;">There are certain rhythm which governs the functioning of life and
                        existence. These rhythm can be called as laws or Dharma. Dharma
                        exist at every
                        sphere of
                        life. If an action or Karma follows the appropriate rhythm or Dharma
                        then it is
                        correct
                        in
                        existential terms otherwise it is destructive.</p>
                  
                 <h2 style="color: #000;">    <b>Sewa:</b></h2>
                      <p style="color: #000;">Being available is seva. Like the Sun, the wind, fruits etc. The most
                        fundamental law or Dharma of existence is Seva. Seva appropriates
                        life and gives
                        a
                        meaning
                        to it.</p>
                  
                  
                  
                      <br>
                  
                      <br>
                      <p align="center">

                      <br>
                      <p style="color: #000;">When Karma, Dharma and Seva fall in the same line then the
                        whole effort
                        is
                        called as Karma yoga. At some point the whole economics of India
                        was
                        designed on
                        this line and evidence proves that it was the most successful and
                        holistic.
